Climate change is considered a serious challenge that can pose an existential threat to humankind. Scientific research confirmed that among the principal contributors to global warming is the "Greenhouse effect". Human activities since the beginning of the industrial revolution have significantly increased the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, combustion, land-use changes through agriculture and deforestation, soil cultivation practices, and the decomposition of waste in landfills significantly contributed to global warming. As a result, the average ground-level temperature is increasing, global warming is leading to more water evaporation and precipitation, the glacier and ice surface are decreasing while the sea level continues to rise. By ignoring climate change, we will continue to degrade our natural ecosystems and increase the frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters (floods, wildfires, heatwaves). This article attempts to introduce three highly related fields: Environmental Science, Climate Change, and outdoor Air Pollution.

## Environmental Science

Environmental science is the interdisciplinary scientific field that examines the interactions between natural and human systems. It uses a broad range of techniques from domains such as physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science to model and monitor natural and artificial system interactions. One of the main goals of environmental science is to model the effects that human systems have on the earth's natural ecosystems and its atmosphere. Environmental science has a vital role, especially because human-induced changes are degrading the planet's life support systems for all living organisms.

In the context of environmental science, a system (human or natural) comprises a set of components that influence one another through the exchange of energy, heat, and matter. The goal of environmental scientists is to assure that human activities do not affect the natural systems' sustainability. Their efforts would allow us to live on earth and use its resources and services in a sustainable way that will enable future generations to do the same while maintaining the same standards of living. Natural environments provide essential ecosystem services such as clean water and air, fish and food crops, and moderate weather conditions that support agricultural and industrial activities. However, if we continue to degrade and destroy the planet's natural system, we may very well impair its ability to provide the essential services we rely on to live.

Data collection and analysis plays an essential role in environmental monitoring. Sensor-based systems monitor natural phenomena for signs of stress or evidence of disturbance. We can loosely divide such monitoring systems into remote sensors (satellite, aerial, LiDAR, etc) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that, respectively, have many advantages and disadvantages. For example, we can use measures such as carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere to estimate the health of a natural ecosystem of interest.

One of the most critical problems addressed by environmental scientists is species extinction. It is directly related to the degradation of natural ecosystems that results in the disappearance of the essential natural services, leading to the extinction of species that reside within the ecosystem. Invasive species, on the other hand, prosper in unbalanced ecosystems and cause a tremendous amount of environmental degradation. Contrary to the belief that invasive species have no relation to human activities, recent studies demonstrated that human industrial activities amplify the spread of such species. For example, the release of pollutants such as nitrate and phosphorus in rivers causes the exponential growth of Rock Snot. Global atmospheric changes caused by humans have also led to such imbalances in our natural ecosystems.

Addressing these issues is not a matter of creating temporary policies. We need to initiate broader and robust regulations on pollution management and industrial activities that would allow us to face the source of the problem head-on. The current skepticism around climate change and environmental degradation stem from the fact that we are not a hundred percent sure about the causal effect between industrial activities and climate change. This issue arises because, within the scientific study of natural ecosystems, we do not have an undisturbed earth to control with. Despite this reality, we think that environmental science is valuable because it acts on limited information and under heavy constraints to save our environment. It is for us to accept the trade-offs and take action before it is too late.

Many environmental problems can be described as a series of chemical reactions. A chemical reaction happens when atoms separate from the molecules they are part of or combine with other molecules (ex. $CH_4 + 2O_2 \to CO_2 + 2H_2O$). Environmental systems are typically studied within a framework that uses matter, energy, and entropy as fundamental concepts.

Starting with the concept of matter, the law of conservation of matter states that matter can not be created nor destroyed, it can only change its form. Formally, for a given closed system, the change in time of the system's mass is equal to the mass that traverses the surface of the system, positive if matter goes in and negative if matter goes out. If we consider the system that encompasses all other subsystems, this condition implies that the total mass $M$, which is the sum of the masses of all components in the system, does not change in time. Where $\rho$ is the volumic density, $t$ is time, and $V$ is the volume of the closed system:

<div style="text-align:center">
$$\frac{dM}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\int \rho dV=0$$
</div>

This law has many environmental implications since we can not simply "destroy" waste, instead, we need to find efficient recycling strategies to turn harmful matter into useful materials. A prime example of this is when we burn fossil fuels, fossil fuels are full of carbon, which originates from the solid coal or liquid petroleum, after burning it, it gets turned to gazes, primarily $CO_2$. Unfortunately, It does not just disappear.

Energy, on the other hand, is the ability to work or transfer heat. The use of energy has led to many benefits to humankind, and it has also led to a great deal of environmental degradation. The first law of thermodynamics tells us that we can not simply create nor destroy energy because the total energy of a close isolated system is constant:

<div style="text-align:center">
$$\Delta U=Q-W$$
</div>

Where $\Delta U$ denotes the internal change in our close natural system, $Q$ is the quantity of energy supplied to the system as heat, and $W$ is the thermodynamic work done by the system on its surroundings. Hence, we can only transform energy from one form to another. An important thing to note is the fact that the quality of the energy will decrease during the transform operation.

Carbon is the most important element for living organisms and the main driver of the industrial revolution. There are six primary processes that drive the carbon cycle:

- Photosynthesis: in which energy from the sun is used by green plants to take in carbon dioxide and water from the atmosphere, and incorporate carbon into their tissue. Its corresponding chemical reaction is:

<div style="text-align:center">
$$CO_{2}+H_{2}O+Energy \to C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+O_{2}$$
</div>

- Respiration: we can consider this process to be the opposite of photosynthesis, biomass is converted back to CO_2 by consumers (organisms). Its corresponding chemical reaction is:

<div style="text-align:center">
$$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+O_{2} \to CO_{2}+H_{2}O+Heat$$
</div>

- Exchange: describes the constant interactions between $CO_2$ and $H_2O$.
- Sedimentation: this process involves solid carbon in the form of organic or inorganic carbon settling at the bottom of the ocean or a water system, hence creating sediments that are rich in carbon.
- Extraction: we extract fossil fuels, meaning fossilized carbon that is organic carbon buried before it completely decomposes, and we bring it back to the earth's surface through industrial activities.
- Combustion: we use fossil combustion to convert fossil fuels or plant matter into $CO_2$ and ash. We release heat and energy in the process.

Almost all industrial activities utilize energy from fossil fuels using combustion and it has been demonstrated that many environmental problems are a result of combustion. Since the industrial revolution, we have had a major influence on the carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels, which had led to a considerable increase in the $CO_2$ atmospheric concentration.

Lastly, Nitrogen is considered to be the most abundant element in the atmosphere. It is essential for plants and animals since it is the building block of proteins. Its cycle is also quite important because humans feed on plants to get nitrogen, and plants absorb it from the soil, which gets it from the atmosphere. Human activities disrupt and accelerate this cycle in a number of ways. For example, during combustion, nitrogen oxides ($NO$ and $NO_2$) form from nitrogen ($N_2$) and oxygen ($O_2$) in the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxides undergo changes and transformations in the atmosphere to finally get transported via the hydrological cycle to plants and soil, which harms natural ecosystems. Nitrogen oxide is also harmful to human and animal health. Depending on variables such as temperature or moisture levels, Nitrogen gets turned into a greenhouse gas that negatively affects whole natural ecosystems.

## Climate Change

Earth has several gases in its atmosphere that trap heat, including carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), methane ($CH_4$), and nitrous oxide ($NO_2$). All living organisms depend on these atmospheric gazes for their survival. The sun's rays that make it through the atmosphere are naturally absorbed by earth's surface. Upon reflection, the rays are radiated back to space with a longer wavelength (infrared light). This lengthening of the wavelength is critical to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse gases absorb some of the outgoing infrared radiation and transmit it back to the earth's surface, causing what is commonly referred to as the "Greenhouse Effect". The greenhouse effect is proportional to the volume of greenhouse gases that reside in the atmosphere.

Many natural phenomena contribute to the earth's increase in average temperature, including the environment's orbit, seasonality, and how reflective the earth's surface is. However, the temperature of our planet is most substantially affected by the density of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by studying ice cores drilled in Antarctica, we know that for the longest time (hundred of thousands of years), carbon dioxide levels have paralleled temperature.

</figure>

The combined concentrations of the three major greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane are at unprecedented levels.

Carbone dioxide is the most common greenhouse gas by volume, and though it may not be the most harmful, its total volume has a large impact on our climate. Most human-generated $CO_2$ is a result of burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil). A certain amount of $CO_2$ is generated through direct emissions: transportation, agriculture, mining, and forestry. These activities are also responsible for releasing most of the methane ($CH_4$) and $N_2O$ that humans release into the atmosphere.

When greenhouse gases trap heat, they raise the temperature of air and ocean water. Most of the warming caused by the greenhouse effect goes into oceans. As the water warms, it expands and increases sea levels. As greenhouse gas concentration increases, the amount of trapped solar radiation also increases, and the earth’s temperature rises. If we continue releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the temperature will increase by as little as 2 degrees celsius.

  <figcaption style="font-size:12px; color:'#484848'">Future change in average surface temperature (1986-2005 to 2081-2100)</figcaption>
</figure>

If we assume there will be a 4 degrees increase in warming, most major cities on the coasts of the world will experience floods, and the heat in many places will be so extreme to the point that most people will rarely leave their homes (by 2100).

What is dangerous about climate change is that it will make wet regions wetter, and dry regions drier. Which will in turn severely damage natural ecosystems and their provided services and increase extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.

## Air Pollution

Smog is a combination of the words "Gas" and "Smoke", smoke is comprised of very tiny and light particles. The reason that smog lasts for a relatively long time is that most small particles have little weight, which enables them to stay longer in the air. Most smoke particles emitted from engines are even smaller than a micron in size, hence they stay in the air for many days.

Air pollution is a serious problem that causes negative problems for our health. We can either categorize pollution sources by mobility:

- Stationary: include industry activities, power plants, volcanos.
- Mobile: include transportation vehicles such as cars and airplanes.

Or we can split the source by its nature:

- Anthropogenic sources: include industry activities, power plants, and transportation mediums.
- Natural sources: include volcanic ashes, natural fires, and dust storms.

We list the following major air pollutants:

- Particulate matter ($PM$): particulates of different sizes and compositions that are released into the atmosphere.
- $NO_2$: Nitrogen dioxide which is produced from combustion and natural decomposition of matter in nature. It can cause wheezing and increase the chance of respiratory infection.
- $SO_2$: Sulfur dioxide, produced from volcanic activities in nature and from the combustion processes of fossil fuels, in transportation and industry. It causes respiratory problems and especially harmful to people with asthma.
- $CO$: carbon monoxide results from fires as well as from transportation and industry activities. carbon monoxide blocks the oxygen from reaching the brain and leads to cardiovascular, respiratory problems, and even death.
- $O_3$: ground-level ozone causes irritation of the respiratory system and reduces the lung's functionalities. It is formed from transportation emissions and chemical plants.
- $Pb$: Lead is a toxic component found in petrol for transportation and well as in paint.

Industrial activities that reinforce climate change are also the main contributors to outdoor ground-level air pollution. Aerosols that constitute the harmful composition of the degraded air quality originate from ground-level excessive machinery exhaust, factory, and fossil fuel activities, wildfires, among others. Smog itself is a direct result of stable warm ground-level weather and sunlight turning some of the aerosols into ozone. The health effects of outdoor air pollution correlate with heart and lung diseases.

Air pollution monitoring plays a critical role that goes beyond estimating a quality index. Monitoring provides us with time-series measurements that, if combined with other contextual datasets (weather, traffic, urban activity), may allow us to uncover relationships within the data to form mitigation strategies and prepare safety measures for extreme events.

Data collection, on the other hand, opens the door to forecasting pollution in the future, and the data can serve as a validator and a feedback medium to conclude the effects of a particular environmental initiative. There are two principal methods for ground-level air quality monitoring, the first one is by using satellites (stationary or orbiting) equipped with specific sensors that provide large scale and near-real-time pollutant concentration estimates. Examples of such satellites include NASA's Aqua, Terra, and Suomi-NPP satellites and the Sentinel-5P satellite. However, the most commonly used technique for reliable and precise ground-level air quality monitoring is through ground-level Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices capable of capturing measurements of many pollutants and enabling us to calculate an overall air quality index.

The main difference between the two methods is the fact that satellites provide large-scale pollutant estimates while IoT devices provide point-level but highly accurate multi-variate estimates.
